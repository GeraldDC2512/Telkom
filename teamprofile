<h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <h4>Gerald Dwi Cipta</h4>
        <p>Hi! My name is Gerald Dwi Cipta. My student number is s3666265 and my email address is <a href="s3666265@student.rmit.edu.au">s3666265@student.rmit.edu.au</a>. Im an international student from Indonesia and currently studying in RMIT's finest Australian campus graduating in winter 2020. As for now, I'm only able to speak Indonesian, English, Chinese. I'm looking forward to learn French because I think that it is an interesting language to communicate with. I consider Racing is my main sport and my hobby. A really interesting fact about me is when i eat a pizza slice, i often leave the crust because I think that it just taste too doughy and i dislike it. My interest in IT includes designing the database architecture. When I was 15 years old, before I took this BP308 Business Information Systems, my elder brother showed me a couple of his projects, which included him putting his customer base for his phone application in a database using MySQL. In just one line of SQL, he could filter out his under 18 users, over 50 users and can see the demographic of his customer base when he needs to review his target market for the application. Me at that point of time not knowing anything about databases, I was amazed and keen to learn more about this database management systems, asked what course is available to learn more about this database and my study agent recommended me this BP308 course.</p>

    <h4>John Usaraga</h4>
        <p>Hello, My name is John Mikael Usaraga, but most people call me Mikey. I was born in Melbourne, Australia, however, my parents are both Filipino. At home, my parents communicate to me in Tagalog, but I can only understand what they are saying because I have trouble speaking it as English is my native language. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies include playing video games, watching anime and playing sports such as badminton and basketball. I have been playing badminton for 5-6 years now, but I don't play it as frequently as I used to.</p>

    <h4>Patrick Cruz</h4>
        <p>Hello there, my name is Patrick Cruz and my studentID is s3657537. I am born in the Philippines but moved to Australia when I was young, so I do not recall much of Philippines. Online gaming is a heavy interest to me and being able to interact with people all over the world in different types of games are one of my main hobbies. </p> <p>My interest in IT came at a young age from playing on the computer for long enough that I wanted to know how they worked. With technology become more and more incorporated within our everyday lives, future developments in the career field I am pursuing may rely on such technologies. To be able to stay relevant in the required skill sets I believe that it is important to have a good understanding in the way the technology works and not just use it. </p> <p> My IT experience is a very lacklustre compared to some of my group members, and only consists of moderate knowledge of Microsoft office programs such as word, PowerPoint and Excel and the basic HTML that we have developed in tutorials </p>

    <h4>Kelvin Huynh</h4>
        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kelvin Huynh, my student number is s3854638 and my work e-mail is s3854638@student.rmit.edu.au. My nationality is a half Chinese and half Vietnamese. I speak a few of languages that includes English, Chinese and Teochew. An interesting fact about me is that I have worked in Target for about 3 years now as a casual.</p>
        <p>I have always been fascinated with technology. How electronics functions, how programs are built and how technology is involved every day. My interest in IT began when I started playing video games. I noticed that the games were running slower, which made me curious to find a solution to work out why these programs were slowing down. I chose to come to RMIT as I have heard that this university has a known reputation for great success in this course. During my studies I hope to learn more about programming and how technology functions.</p>

<h3>Career Plans</h3>
    <h4>Gerald Dwi Cipta</h4>
        <p>This job is an IT Business Analyst job. It is a bridge that connects both IT world and the business world as business analyst helps business to implement technology to meet their needs and requirements and to tackle each and every possible problem in a cost-effective manner. A bachelors degree in Business Information Systems to know what and how should we do. Next, the skills needed for this job includes working in groups, communication skill, problem-solving skill and critical-thinking skills.</p>
        <p>Comparing my ideal job with others, John and Nicholas has the same ideal job which is software engineer, where there is very less similarity, but I will still be working in order to fix the business problems using their coding skills. Patrick's ideal job will have the most common elements compared tot he others where we both need to organize staff, but his concer will be mainly about the organization's inventory management system. With Kelvin's job, his job is all about security where the common elements are we both analyse the problem and propse possible solutions but my ideal job is mainly about business processes while Kelvin's job is about the cyber security. Lastly, Tonys's job is almost similar to John's and Nicholas' ideal job, but Tony's job is about building the software website and application. Tony's job can collaborate withe my ideal job when I propose a problem which needs a technological solution, we can brainstorm how the application or software will be or look like to overcome the problems and turn it to a technological solution.</p>

    <h4>John Usaraga</h4>
        <p>My ideal job is working as a software engineer, developing and building computer systems software and applications software. This occupation appeals to me the most as the work I would do could branch out into developing operating systems and computer games. Due to my experiences growing up, being influenced by video games, and wanting to know how the software behind it is built, I believe that this job is ideal for me. For this job, I would need to master a variety of programming languages, such as C++, C#, JavaScript, and Python. Some general skills I would also need to have for this job include software development, Object-oriented design (OOD), Software testing and debugging, problem-solving and logical thinking, written and verbal communication, teamwork.</p>
        <p>Comparing this job with those of the other members of this group, I have come to realize how IT can expand into different types of jobs. Out of the 6 members of the group, I do share the same Job interest with one of them which is also being a software engineer. What differentiates my ideal job with Cyber Security Analysts, Systems Managers, Web Developers, and Business Analysts is that this job focuses on developing and building computer systems software and applications software, whereas the other ones focus on aspects such as: carrying out security measures to protect </p>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Patrick Cruz</h4>
        <p>When comparing with my group members career plans there are differences in our required skill sets seeing as I am more focused on a Logistical aspect while others are more programming and software related, however some elements are still in common. The reliance of communication skills is shared among all our profession choices whiles for IT skills I only share my skillset with one members preferred job title. While most of the groups job wants to create and program applications and software my job description mainly manages and optimizes inventory flow. There are members in the group who share the analyst part of my ideal job as a similarity. Overall there are quite a few differences in the core aspects of the ideal jobs between me and my group members while maintaining similarities in the non IT general skillsets required.  Comparing with the career pathways that each of my group members plan to undertake there are very high similarities in the previous years of experience in a similar position in the field selected.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h4>Nicholas Santosa</h4>
        <p>My ideal job is a Software Engineer. A Software Engineer creates an outline for programmers to program. They work closely with team members and internal participants to problem solve through software development. Software Engineers need strong database development skills, ability to communicate effectively and efficiently, strong problem-solving skills and ability to use web services. I have the same ideal job as Mikey except he prefers to be in a senior role which may require him to have more of a leadership role. His career plan should be the same or very similar to mine, because we both want the same goal. Gerald's ideal job is different to mine, as mine concerns code and software development while his is focused around using analysis and design techniques to fix business problems with information technology. His career plan requires the same amount of time in job experience but in the field of System Analyst. He requires a different degree none the same as mine. His skills are focused on teamwork and communication and basic computer skills, where my skills are focused on code and software development. Tony's job is very similar to mine dealing with code, but mine develops what coders should do, he troubleshoots the coding problems and what processors and technologies the development team should use. His job requires the same amount of time for experience but in a Software Architecture field. The skills needed for his job is towards a team, while mine is focused on coding and software development. Kelvin's ideal job is focused on security for companies and doesn't this by monitoring security issues and installs software to protect their systems, they may create the software that they use, which is linked to my job, but my job is focused on creating software and code. Kelvin’s job requires the same minimum amount of job experience but in a Cyber Security Analyst field. He has very similar skills, but mine are more focused on code and software development. Patrick’s job and mine aren't closely linked, but my job can create software that Patrick may implement when monitoring transactions, margins, returns, and other financial data to inform decision makers. His job requires more job experience to mine in a similar or same role to Inventory and Systems Manager, he also needs a bachelor’s degree in Business, Logistics or similar as appose to my Computer Science or related degree. His skillset revolves around a team and presenting commercially, while mine is focused on programs and software development.</p>

    <h4>Kelvin Huynh</h4>
        <p>My ideal job would be working as a Cyber Security Analyst. This field offers the position to work on planning out and making sure that the security requirements are up to date within an organisation. Working in this field would allow me to observe threats that may breach into an organisation’s computer network. It offers the chance to work with other IT teams within an organisation to ensure that cyber security is embedded at all locations. This job is appealing to me, as it offers the chance to work with an organisation that already strives to help other organisations that require help in measuring security. This position does require a minimum of 5 years of experience in working in other cyber security roles, the ability to conversate with others that un-aware of IT, prior knowledge of cloud environments and have experience with security measures including; encryptions, password access management systems and proxies. This position also requires knowledge in SIEM tools.</p>
        <p>Each member in our groups falls under the same category of working within an organisation to provide services in order for that organisation to run efficiently. When comparing my ideal job as a cyber security analyst to the members in my group, similarities are visible with system analysing. Although my ideal job mainly focuses on analysing and planning security measures to protect an organisation, we share a common purpose of problem solving, planning, and managing aspects of an organisation. In contrast, my ideal job differentiates when compared to software engineering, software architecture and inventory management. To summarise, our group contains members that do share the same similarities of my ideal job with others focusing on a different aspect when working in the industry.</p>
