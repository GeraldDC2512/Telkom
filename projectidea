<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<br><br><br><br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <h4>Topic</h4>
        <p>Telkom+ purpose is to create a connectivity towards &quotnon-smart&quot devices that aren&apost able to connect directly to the internet and help organise the wide variety of smart devices that are currently available. With the ever-growing market of smart technology, household appliances today are becoming more and more feature rich and their capabilities are higher than previous non internet capable versions of themselves. We want our users to have the complete freedom to control and connect devices for a better lifestyle, giving them no restraint to which device can or can&apost connect to our application, but rather encouraging them to connect &quotnon-smart&quot devices. The ability to streamline them all within a simple, user friendly interface is what our main goals are.</p>
        <p>The expected outcome is to support the growth of smart technology. With the developments of required technology, such as sensors and faster internet, becoming cheaper and more accessible, more people are incorporating smart appliances into their daily lives. As more people become more accustomed to things being on demand and ready when they need it, the demand for smart technology rises and the need to be able to control them.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>Our motivation behind this project is the growth of IoT. In 2018, a survey was conducted by the Statista Research Department which produced an estimate of 22 Billion IoT devices connected around the world. In the future the amount of IoT devices that were predicted by Statista will be 38.6 Billion IoT devices by the end of 2025. Due to this growth, it would be necessary and helpful if all devices could be connected and controlled via a single application on the phone to allow for easier and more efficient use. What makes this project so interesting is that our product also allows non-smart devices to be controlled via the application.</p>
        <p> In terms of how Telkom+ does fit in with the current IT trends, currently the demand for products like Telkom+ as well as smart devices are increasing, this is backed by the  research that states  the value of the smart home device market is set to grow from $55 billion in 2016 to $174 billion by 2025.Therefore, With the continuous innovation, cheaper costs to make and the more smart devices being implemented in homes, Telkom+ will be more accessible for more people in the future. As for what I would show to a future employer I would show the simplicity of Telkom+ as I feel it would demonstrate an understanding of what the consumer wants and needs. I would also show the differences of Telkom+ to similar devices to demonstrate the understanding of how to make a product more unique.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        <h4>Landscape</h4>
        <p>In the market, the similar products are Echo, Homehub, Hub2, SmartThings and HomeKit. The current market leader for the home automation section is Amazon, followed by Google. Other competitors include Samsung, Wink and Apple.</p>
        <p>Some of the points of differences with our project compared to our competitors is the addition to connect “non-smart” devices to our home automation application. Currently, our competitors like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa require smart devices to be turned on and connected to the internet. With our project we have designed a power board that receives and sends information to our application. When appliances are connected to the board, the application can control when these devices will receive power to turn it on or off. This product will allow our users to avoid constantly having to activate/deactivate the appliances from the switches. The home automation application is used to control all devices that are connected via a wifi connection or through our power board. </p>

<h3>Detailed Description</h3>
<h4>Aims</h4>
<p>The aim is to be able to provide a service that enables a seamless integration of smart devices to communicate together to streamline everyday tasks within your household. This is included as the aim as it is the service our group aims to provide with our development of a new application and power strip to support it</p>
<p>The core goal to achieve is the creation and development of the power strip component within our idea. It is essential to make this part function as intended as it is what our entire design is based around and is the key aspect that separates our idea from competitors that are already in the market.</p>
<p>A goal to assist in reaching our aims is the essential design of the user interface of the application being easy enough and clear enough to use to make consumers want to swap to our product. As our main competitors within the smart home technology environment are Google HomeHub and Amazons Echo, large companies with a worldwide fanbase it is important to provide a service of equal standards to become considered a substitute.</p>
<p>Another goal is to make the application developer friendly and easy for manufacturers to incorporate compatibilities with their smart home appliances. This is a major priority to help support the growth of smart technologies within households and ensure the set-up process is simple and causes minimal confusion or uncertainty. This also companies to be more willing to provide compatibility with our application if it is simple to link to existing code.</p>
<br><br>

<h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
<h5>Telkom+ Product (Power Strip)</h5>
<p>Telkom+ is a 'smart' power strip that connects all electrical appliances to an app where they can be controlled. This product of Telkom+ will connect all devices that are plugged into the strip and act as a way to either control all features of any smart device connected to the power strip and/or have the ability to turn off or on any devices via the app. What inspired us to do such a project was because of situations where a light was left on outside of your room and it needed to be turned off, however, you are already tucked inside of your bed and do not have the energy to leave it. Other situations that also inspired us would be whether you left your mini electrical stove on or off and are already on a plane heading straight to the Netherlands. It is situations like these that made us want to come up with a project idea such as this.</p>
<p>Originally, Telkom+ was just a simple minicomputer that uses Raspberry Pi as the "Middleman" for the wall power socket to the electrical appliance to make it automated. The product itself would then be connected to the home Wi-Fi to obtain the static IP address of the Raspberry Pi and so the Wi-Fi signal can control the Raspberry Pi to kill the power or reconnect the power to the electrical appliance. Having reconsidered the project itself, it was decided that the original idea would be too hard to implement/create realistically as it was very confusing to understand all the technicalities behind it. Instead, we had come up with the idea to make it into a ‘smart’ power strip which would have the ability to turn on and off devices, control all features of any smart device, and have a similar interactive AI feature that devices such as Alexa, and Google Home have. The reason behind including an interactive AI system in the product was because since our product was able to control any device using an app, to make it easier for users, an interactive AI would be suitable for this situation as it would allow for much more efficient use.  Although it can be argued whether our product needs an app as another way to control the devices, it is still necessary for users who have any trouble speaking or are not within range for the product to register their voice. The interactive AI feature also puts our product into the smart home device category, so companies such as Amazon and Google would be some of our main competitors. What differentiates our product with any of these companies existing smart devices, however, is that our product can utilise any device which needs power, meaning that devices which don’t have any smart features such as a microwave can still be used with our product as long as it has a power cable to connect it to it.</p>
<h5>Telkom+ Product (Power Strip)</h5>
<p>Alongside the actual product itself, there will be a phone application that would be compatible with all phone OS, whether it is iOS or Android. This application would allow users to control all their devices connected to a power strip. If there are any smart devices plugged into the power strip, users would be able to unlock all controls/features that the smart device has. For example, changing the colour of light on a smart led. If there are any non-smart devices plugged into the power strip, such as a microwave, users would be given the ability to turn on or off the device. In a report created by the Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC), they talk about how they have found that many of today's smart TVs use a lot more power in standby mode if they're waiting for a voice assistant to turn them on which in some cases is enough to double their annual energy consumption. Due to this report, we as a group decided that by including a feature where users are able to turn off or on any device connected/plugged into the power strip without it having to be on standby mode, they are able to also save energy, reducing the cost of their electricity bill.</p>
<p>When using the app, assuming the user has already created an account, first, a username and password are requested or, if enabled, users can use the FaceID recognition that iOS has or the user fingerprint. After the credentials are verified by the app, users will be taken to the home. The home screen consists of 3 main features, settings, devices, and a voice command button for the AI feature. Within the ‘settings’ menu users are given options such as adjusting the information for their profile and a help and forum menu where they will be able to find help for any issues that they encounter. For the ‘devices’ menu users are able to see all of their electrical devices that have been connected to a power strip. For all devices, if clicked on, users are given the ability to turn it on or off. There will also be an indication for the user which shows whether the device is turned off or on to help prevent any mistakes if the user wants to turn off a device but accidentally turns it on. For smart devices, if clicked on, users are given all the functions/features that the smart device can do, able to control it. If a new device is connected to the power strip, it will automatically be synced and listed inside of the users’ ‘devices’ menu. If a device is removed from the power strip, the device will no longer be able to be controlled via the app, until plugged/connected again to the power strip. Users’ are also able to redesign the interface of the app in the ‘devices’ menu as they are able to move each device on this list into a different location (i.e. moving a device from the bottom of the list to the top). This would help users’ access some of their devices quicker than others as the user might prioritize or use a device more than others and want/need to access it quicker. Lastly, within the ‘voice command’ feature, users’ are able to interact with the AI. By including this feature in the app, users are able to access information without having to leave the app and use a browser. As other smart devices have this feature in their applications, it is only fitting if our application utilises it too so that no consumer would feel ripped off by not including a feature that a competitor has.</p>
<br><br>

<h4>Roles</h4>
<p>For our project there are some roles that we can allocate when developing our project. Currently, we have some experience coding in Java and Python so this project will allow all of us to further develop our knowledge in these coding languages. We would include the role of a User Interface Designer to construct how the home automation application will be utilised by our users. Also, a Technical Designer would be useful to develop the power board that would be used in conjunction with our application. If any of our team members would like to participate with designing the power board or help with designing the user interface, this project would allow them to expand their skills in this area. </p>
<br><br>

<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
<p>The scope of this project involves the ability to interlink communication of tasks towards multiple internet connectable household appliances, smart devices, and be able organize them and operate them all from the convenience of an application on your internet capable mobile device. This is the major priority of Telkom+ and our focus, while we are focusing on that primarily. Our secondary opportunity to provide additional benefits compared to our competitors is the implementation of an application controlled power strip that allows control of which devices are connected and be able to turn them on or off allowing for a remote on/off switch on applications that can be used to save power, and turn on a certain device the same time another is being utilized. While this is another deliverable that Telkom+ aims to achieve, this is not our main priority as we believe that the successful implantation of the main application to be developed is the main selling point to our idea.</p>
<br><br>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>Our base software used to create this is Raspberry Pi, we would need this to create the device that connects the "non-smart" devices together. We would also need the licences for current programming software's for Android such as, Java, Kotlin, C# or C++ just to name a few and software’s for Apple like, Swift. We would need hardware to create the adaptor for “non-smart” devices and the Raspberry Pi. Our group has experience programming in Java, C and some Micro bit experience, but the skills in these categories are still basic. None of us have any experience with Swift, Kotlin or Raspberry Pi, and this project gives us a chance to learn and pick up a few things for these languages and hardware.</p>
<br><br>

<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>The first testing that would be done would be a quick online survey, seeing what the user would want or expect from Telkom+ such as the design or the type of function they would want. As how we would do the testing, an online survey would probably be the fastest as well as the more diverse since online survey can get a wide variety of people to do it, either age or culture. A large diverse pool of about 100 people, from different ages, culture and gender would be the best, as it will emulate the type of consumer that would most likely buy this product since this product will benefit many people. Another test that will be developed for the test is a prototype of the device of Telkom+ and see if it can at least connect and function with one smart device and close on and off non smart devices. This sort of testing is required as if we start trying with many devices, when there is an issue it would be harder to pinpoint.</p>

<h4>Risks</h4>
<p>A major risk about creating a new product and application is that it might not take off, all the funding and time spent might all be wasted if the product doesn&apost have consumers. Some of the language to code for the application may be learnt slower than others and this might slow down the progress of developing the application and the functions. The documentation between the group might be hard to understand or might not even exist, this can affect the progress of the development too. Another risk could be the ability to transfer documents, the uncertainty that someone might intercept the documents or that some members are unable to send through documents due to their internet restrictions. A major risk would consist of our adaptor being inadequate to grant access for &quotnon-smart&quot devices to connect with the Wi-Fi making it a smart device. The Raspberry Pi or similar products might be difficult to understand or achieve our desired goal.</p>
<br><br>

<h4>Group Processes and Communications</h4>
<p>Telkom+ group mostly record conversations formally in Microsoft Teams, but, informal conversations are held in Facebook messenger or discord. We tend to pin messages that are important so that we can access the message easily. As mentioned in the group process, full Telkom+ group member meetings take place 3 times a week, in addition to that, there would be an extra of 1 meeting to discuss the urgent matters, not all group members could attend but we record the meeting for those who missed the meeting.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Telkom+ group members are easily contactable, and with that, we had no issue about non-responding group members in our team. But, if such a case happens, we will try to direct message the member or call through facebook messenger and call them a number of times. If the member is still ignoring the messages and calls, on behalf of the group, group leader will have to take action on emailing Dr. B, and reflect the group member's behavious in SparkPLUS.</p>
