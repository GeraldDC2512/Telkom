<h2>Project Description</h2>
<br><br><br><br>

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</p>
<p>The project can be improved upon as more users take this project into their lives. There will be many different improvements like better functions, adaptability to crisis, and minor improvements with design and bugs. The project would need to have impenetrable security, as it’s connected to via the client’s Wi-Fi, which can be a gateway to their private documents, this can be improved on with security measures like a simple username and password or we can implement facial recognition and finger print identification, we can also go the extra mile and have double authentication with a phone number or email address. Better functionality could include with more capacity than turning on and off appliances. The adaptability to crisis can be developed and updated on when the circumstance occurs.</p>
<p>What technological or other developments make this possible?</p>
<p>Currently our project relies on Raspberry Pi to create the project, other technologies that allow the access to house equipment or better home automation technology. Some ideas could include smart lights, that adjust to the natural light that radiates from windows, motion sensing lights, that could turn on the lights but also start recording for the specific area and create better security for homes, like, ability to control cameras around the house or if there’s a security breach it will lock all the doors and Telcom+ can be personalised for each family member and the house can detect if they’re an intruder or not with the application. Telcom+ could become a better and cheaper application if we used an alternative to the Raspberry Pi being the Pine A64 at the current moment and better technologies similar to the Raspberry Pi could create more profit for the company and cheaper costs for clients.</p>
